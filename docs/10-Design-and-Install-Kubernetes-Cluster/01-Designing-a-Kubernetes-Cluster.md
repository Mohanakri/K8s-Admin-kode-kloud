# Designing a Kubernetes Cluster

  - Take me to [Lecture](https://kodekloud.com/topic/design-a-kubernetes-cluster/)

  In this lecture, the instructor discusses the considerations and steps involved in designing a Kubernetes cluster. Key points include:

### Preliminary Questions
- Purpose: Learning, development, testing, or production.
- Cloud Adoption: Managed by a cloud provider or self-hosted.
- Workloads: Types and number of applications, resource requirements, network traffic.

### Cluster Design Based on Purpose
1. **Learning Purposes**:
   - Use Minikube or a single-node cluster with kubeadm on local VMs or cloud providers like GCP or AWS.
2. **Development and Testing**:
   - Multi-node cluster with a single master and multiple worker nodes.
   - Tools: kubeadm, Google Container Engine, AWS, AKS on Azure.
3. **Production**:
   - Highly available multi-node cluster with multiple master nodes.
   - Tools: kubeadm, GCP, kOps on AWS, other supportive platforms.

### Cluster Size and Resource Requirements
- Max Capacity: 5,000 nodes, 150,000 pods, 300,000 containers, 100 pods per node.
- Resource Requirements: Vary based on cluster size.
- Cloud Providers: Automatically select node sizes.
- On-prem Deployment: Use specified numbers as a base.

### Deployment Options
- On-prem: kubeadm.
- GCP: Google Container Engine with easy maintenance features.
- AWS: kOps.
- Azure: AKS.

### Storage Considerations
- High-performance workloads: SSD-backed storage.
- Multiple concurrent access: Network-based storage.
- Shared access: Persistent storage volumes.
- Define different storage classes for applications.

### Node Deployment
- Nodes can be physical or virtual.
- Example Setup: Three nodes (one master, two worker nodes) using virtual machines on VirtualBox.
- Master Nodes: Host control components; best practice to dedicate them for controlling components only.
- Worker Nodes: Host workloads.
- 64-bit Linux OS recommended for nodes.

### Additional Considerations
- Control Plane Components: Typically on master nodes, but etcd clusters can be separated in large clusters.
- High Availability: Different topologies will be discussed in the upcoming lecture.

### Conclusion
- Summary of key design considerations for Kubernetes clusters.
- Links for further reading provided.
- Certification Exam: No need to memorize numbers; available in documentation.
- Next Steps: Upcoming lectures will cover provisioning an actual cluster from scratch.

The lecture emphasizes planning and choosing appropriate tools and configurations based on the cluster's purpose and expected workloads.

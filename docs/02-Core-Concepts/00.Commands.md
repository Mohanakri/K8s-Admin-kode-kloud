Take me to the Video Tutorial In Kubernetes, several directories and folders are integral to the operation and management of the cluster and its components. These directories contain configuration files, data, logs, and other necessary files. Here's a summary of the key Kubernetes folders and their descriptions:
1. /etc/kubernetes/
Description: Contains configuration files for the Kubernetes cluster and its components.
Contents:
admin.conf: Configuration for the cluster administrator.
controller-manager.conf: Configuration for the controller manager.
scheduler.conf: Configuration for the scheduler.
kubelet.conf: Configuration for the kubelet.
apiserver.conf: Configuration for the API server.
Certificates and other security-related files.
2. /var/lib/kubelet/
Description: Used by the kubelet to manage pods, container storage, and other node-level operations.
Contents:
Pod manifests and state information.
Volume mounts and data for persistent volumes.
Configuration and runtime data for the kubelet.
3. /etc/cni/net.d/
Description: Contains configuration files for Container Network Interface (CNI) plugins.
Contents:
Network configuration files that specify how pods are networked.
Configuration settings for different CNI plugins like Calico, Flannel, and Weave.
4. /opt/cni/bin/
Description: Stores the binary files for CNI plugins.
Contents:
Executable files for various CNI plugins required for pod networking.
5. /var/lib/etcd/
Description: Data directory for the etcd key-value store used by Kubernetes.
Contents:
Data files containing the state of the Kubernetes cluster.
Snapshot files and backup data for etcd.
6. /etc/systemd/system/kubelet.service.d/
Description: Contains systemd drop-in files for customizing the kubelet service.
Contents:
Custom configuration files that modify or extend the default kubelet service settings.
7. /etc/docker/
Description: Contains Docker configuration files, which are often used as the container runtime in Kubernetes.
Contents:
daemon.json: Configuration file for Docker daemon settings.
Other Docker-related configuration files.
8. /var/log/
Description: Contains log files for various Kubernetes components and system logs.
Contents:
kube-apiserver.log: Logs for the Kubernetes API server.
kube-scheduler.log: Logs for the Kubernetes scheduler.
kube-controller-manager.log: Logs for the Kubernetes controller manager.
kubelet.log: Logs for the kubelet service.
docker.log: Logs for the Docker daemon.
System logs and logs for other Kubernetes components.
9. /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/
Description: Contains service account tokens and secrets mounted into pods.
Contents:
Token files and secret data for accessing the Kubernetes API.
Other secret data used by applications running in the cluster.
10. /etc/ssl/certs/
Description: Stores SSL certificates used by Kubernetes components for secure communication.
Contents:
CA certificates.
SSL/TLS certificates for secure communication between Kubernetes components.
11. /usr/local/bin/
Description: Typically contains user-installed binaries, including Kubernetes command-line tools.
Contents:
Binaries for kubectl, kubeadm, kubelet, and other utilities.
12. /etc/kubernetes/manifests/
Description: Contains static pod manifests that are managed by the kubelet on the master node.
Contents:
Static pod definitions for control plane components like kube-apiserver, kube-controller-manager, kube-scheduler, and etcd.
13. /var/lib/kubelet/plugins/
Description: Contains plugin-related data for the kubelet.
Contents:
Information about various plugins used by the kubelet.
These directories are essential for the functioning of a Kubernetes cluster, containing critical configuration files, runtime data, logs, and security credentials necessary for managing and operating the cluster effectively.

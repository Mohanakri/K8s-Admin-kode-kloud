# Volumes

  - Take me to [Lecture](https://kodekloud.com/topic/volumes/)
In this lecture, the instructor introduces volumes in Kubernetes, starting with an analogy to volumes in Docker. Docker containers are transient, meaning they are short-lived, and the data within them gets deleted along with the container. To persist data, volumes are attached to containers.

Similarly, in Kubernetes, pods are transient, and to retain data generated by pods, volumes are attached. The lecture outlines a simple implementation of volumes in a single-node Kubernetes cluster, where a volume is created with a specified storage path on the host, allowing data to persist even after the pod is deleted.

The instructor explains different storage options for volumes, starting with the host path option, which is suitable for single-node clusters but not recommended for multi-node clusters due to synchronization issues across nodes. Kubernetes supports various storage solutions such as NFS, cluster-affairs, Flocker, Fiber Channel, Ceph FS, ScaleIO, and cloud-based solutions like AWS EBS, Azure Disk, and Google Persistent Disk.

For example, to configure an AWS Elastic Block Store (EBS) volume, the instructor demonstrates replacing the host path field with the AWS EBS field, specifying the volume ID and file system type.

Overall, the lecture provides a foundational understanding of volumes in Kubernetes, highlighting their role in persisting data and outlining different storage options available for Kubernetes volumes.


================================================================================================================



In this section, we will take a look at **Volumes**

- We discussed about Docker storage, If we don't attach the volume in the container runtime, when container destroyed and then all data will be lost. So, We need to persist data into the Docker container so we attach a volume to the containers when they are created.
- The data are processed by the container is now placed in this volume thereby retaining it permanently. Even if the container is deleted the data remains in the volume.

- In the Kubernetes world, the PODs created in Kubernetes are transient in nature. When a POD is created to process data and then deleted, the data processed by it gets deleted as well. 
- For example, We create a simple POD that generated a random between 1 and 100 and writes that to a file at `/opt/number.out`. To persist into the volume.
- We create a volume for that. In this case I specify a path `/data` on the host. Files are stored in the directory data on my node. We use the volumeMounts field in each container to mount the data-volume to the directory `/opt` within the container. The random number will now be written to `/opt` mount inside the container, which happens to be on the data-volume which is in fact `/data` directory on the host. When the pod gets deleted, the file with the random number still lives on the host.

## Volume Storage Options

- In the volumes, hostPath volume type is fine with the single node. It's not recomended for use with the multi node cluster.
- In the Kubernetes, it supports several types of standard storage solutions such as NFS, GlusterFS, CephFS or public cloud solutions like AWS EBS, Azure Disk or Google's Persistent Disk.

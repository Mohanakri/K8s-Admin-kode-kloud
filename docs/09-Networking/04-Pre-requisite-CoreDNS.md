# Pre-requisite CoreDNS

  - Take me to [Lecture](https://kodekloud.com/topic/prerequisite-coredns/)
Prerequisite - CoreDNS
In the previous lecture we saw why you need a DNS server and how it can help manage name resolution in large environments with many hostnames and Ips and how you can configure your hosts to point to a DNS server. In this article we will see how to configure a host as a DNS server.



We are given a server dedicated as the DNS server, and a set of Ips to configure as entries in the server. There are many DNS server solutions out there, in this lecture we will focus on a particular one – CoreDNS.



So how do you get core dns? CoreDNS binaries can be downloaded from their Github releases page or as a docker image. Let’s go the traditional route. Download the binary using curl or wget. And extract it. You get the coredns executable.






Run the executable to start a DNS server. It by default listens on port 53, which is the default port for a DNS server.



Now we haven’t specified the IP to hostname mappings. For that you need to provide some configurations. There are multiple ways to do that. We will look at one. First we put all of the entries into the DNS servers /etc/hosts file.



And then we configure CoreDNS to use that file. CoreDNS loads it’s configuration from a file named Corefile. Here is a simple configuration that instructs CoreDNS to fetch the IP to hostname mappings from the file /etc/hosts. When the DNS server is run, it now picks the Ips and names from the /etc/hosts file on the server.




CoreDNS also supports other ways of configuring DNS entries through plugins. We will look at the plugin that it uses for Kubernetes in a later section.

In this section, we will take a look at **CoreDNS**

## Installation of CoreDNS

```
$ wget https://github.com/coredns/coredns/releases/download/v1.7.0/coredns_1.7.0_linux_amd64.tgz
coredns_1.7.0_linux_amd64.tgz

```

## Extract tar file

```
$ tar -xzvf coredns_1.7.0_linux_amd64.tgz
coredns
```

## Run the executable file

- Run the executable file to start a DNS server. By default, it's listen on port 53, which is the default port for a DNS server.

```
$ ./coredns

```

## Configuring the hosts file

- Adding entries into the `/etc/hosts` file.
- CoreDNS will pick the ips and names from the `/etc/hosts` file on the server.

```
$ cat > /etc/hosts
192.168.1.10    web
192.168.1.11    db
192.168.1.15    web-1
192.168.1.16    db-1
192.168.1.21    web-2
192.168.1.22    db-2
```

## Adding into the Corefile

```
$ cat > Corefile
. {
	hosts   /etc/hosts
}

```

## Run the executable file

```
$ ./coredns

```

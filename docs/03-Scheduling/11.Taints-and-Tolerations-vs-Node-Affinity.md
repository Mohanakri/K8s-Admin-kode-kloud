  - Take me to [Video Tutorial](https://kodekloud.com/topic/taints-and-tolerations-vs-node-affinity/)
Here's a summary of the article "Tying Together Taints, Tolerations, and Node Affinity":

### Objective:
- The article aims to demonstrate a combined approach using taints, tolerations, and node affinity in Kubernetes.
- The goal is to ensure specific pods (`blue`, `red`, `green`) are placed on corresponding nodes (`blue`, `red`, `green`) while preventing unwanted pod-node assignments.

### Approach:
1. **Taints and Tolerations**:
   - Apply taints to nodes (`blue`, `red`, `green`) to mark them with their respective colors.
   - Set tolerations on pods (`blue`, `red`, `green`) to tolerate the taints of their corresponding colors.
   - This ensures that each colored pod is placed on its respective colored node.
   - However, other pods may still end up on these nodes, which is not desired.

2. **Node Affinity**:
   - Label the nodes with their colors (`blue`, `red`, `green`).
   - Set node selectors on pods (`blue`, `red`, `green`) to specify affinity to their respective colored nodes.
   - This ensures that each colored pod is placed on its corresponding colored node.
   - However, it doesn't prevent other pods from being placed on these

In this section, we will take a look at Taints and Tolerations vs Node Affinity
- Taints and Tolerations do not guarantee that the pods will only prefer these nodes; in this case, the red pods may end up on one of the other nodes that do not have a taint or toleration set.

- As such, a combination of taints and tolerations and node affinity rules can be used together to completely dedicate nodes for specific parts.

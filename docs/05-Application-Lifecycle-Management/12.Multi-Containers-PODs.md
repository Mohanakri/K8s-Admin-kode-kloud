# Multi-Container Pods
  - Take me to [Video Tutorial](https://kodekloud.com/topic/multi-container-pods-2/)


Here's a summary of the article on Multi-Container Pods:

### Introduction to Multi-Container Pods
- The section introduces the concept of multi-container pods in Kubernetes.
- In microservices architecture, applications are broken down into smaller, independent components called microservices.
- Sometimes, these microservices need to work together, such as a web server and a logging service.
- Multi-container pods allow these services to be paired together, sharing the same life cycle, network space, and storage volumes.

### Advantages of Multi-Container Pods
- **Independent Development and Deployment:**
  - Each service can be developed and deployed separately.
  - Services can be scaled up or down independently.

- **Shared Life Cycle:**
  - Multi-container pods are created together and destroyed together.
  - Ensures that paired services are always running together.

- **Shared Network Space:**
  - Containers within the same pod share the same network space.
  - They can refer to each other using localhost, simplifying communication.

- **Shared Storage Volumes:**
  - Multi-container pods have access to the same storage volumes.
  - No need to establish volume sharing between pods for communication.

### Creating Multi-Container Pods
- To create a multi-container pod, add the new container information to the existing pod definition file.
- The `containers` section under the `spec` section of a pod definition file is an array, allowing multiple containers in a single pod.
- Example: Adding a new container named `log-agent` to an existing pod.

### Conclusion
- Multi-container pods are useful when two or more services need to work closely together.
- They allow for easier communication between paired services, shared resources, and a streamlined deployment process.
- The article encourages readers to practice configuring multi-container pods in the coding exercises section.

This section provides an overview of the benefits and implementation of multi-container pods in Kubernetes. It highlights the advantages of creating pods with paired services, such as simplified communication, shared resources, and a unified life cycle. Readers are encouraged to explore further by practicing the configuration of multi-container pods in Kubernetes.

- To create a new multi-container pod, add the new container information to the pod definition file.
  ```
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: Pod

    name: simple-webapp
    labels:
      name: simple-webapp
